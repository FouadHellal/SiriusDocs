The Network Alert System (NAS) is a critical subsystem of the network management framework. It provides comprehensive visibility and control over network alerts â€” from end devices to core switches and routers. NAS enables administrators to monitor, analyze, and respond to issues efficiently, thereby enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the network.

### Features and Functionalities

#### Network Alerts Dashboard

The NAS features a powerful dashboard that visualizes ongoing network alerts and highlights the current health status of the infrastructure.

Key elements include:

*   **Devices on Alert**: Displays the number of devices currently experiencing issues.
    
*   **Alerts by Severity Level**: Bar and pie charts represent the number of alerts categorized using the standard syslog severity scale (0 = Emergency, 4 = Warning).
    

These visualizations enable administrators to quickly understand the scale and seriousness of issues across the network.

#### List of System Alerts

The NAS provides a detailed, filterable table of all generated system alerts for granular analysis and response.

#### AI Recommendation and Insight

One of the standout features of NAS is its AI-driven recommendation engine. This system helps administrators resolve issues efficiently by providing:

*   **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies the underlying problem of the alert.
    
*   **Resolution Guidance**: Provides step-by-step instructions tailored to the alert.
    
*   **Device-Specific Commands**: Offers relevant commands based on the device vendor/OS, supporting multi-vendor environments such as:
    
    *   Cisco IOS (Cisco)
        
    *   Junos OS (Juniper)
        
    *   Huawei VRP (Huawei)
        

This level of intelligence helps significantly reduce troubleshooting time and minimizes manual errors.

#### Integration with Other Subsystems

NAS is seamlessly integrated into the broader system. It interacts with other modules (like QTI) to provide a unified view of the network health and event correlation.

### Future Enhancements

The NAS subsystem is built with extensibility in mind. Future improvements will include:

#### Predictive Alerting

*   **Proactive Detection**: Analyze device configurations and security services to forecast potential issues.
    
*   **Predictive Alerts**: Warnings are issued before a failure occurs if risky configurations or disabled services are detected.
    

#### Automated Remediation

*   **AI-Driven Fixes**: Automatically execute commands or scripts based on the AI recommendation engine to resolve known issues without human intervention.
    

#### Real-Time Notifications

*   **Instant Visibility**: New alerts will trigger real-time notifications in the NOS sidebar and within the NTM module, ensuring administrators are informed immediately.
    

#### Visibility and Transparency

*   **Ticketing System**: A built-in coordination system will allow administrators to:
    
    *   Track which alerts are actively being handled.
        
    *   Avoid duplicated efforts.
        
    *   Improve collaboration between network teams.
